            This is the question that has been explored by researchers at the
            University of Basel and their colleagues at the University of
            Tsukuba in Japan through a large-scale analysis of the scientific
            literature. They have used this analysis to derive recommendations
            that they recently published in the journal Nature Human Behavior.
            <br />
            <br />
            Just like our physical condition, cognitive performance changes over
            the course of our lives. There is great for potential for
            improvement during childhood (cognitive development phase) and
            during old age (cognitive degradation phase). However, the research
            group of the Department of Sport, Exercise and Health (DSBG) at the
            University of Basel was unable to find an indicator of different
            levels of effectiveness of sporting activities within the varying
            age groups.
            <br />
            <br />
            Furthermore, sporting activities from primary school age to later
            age do not have to be fundamentally different in order to improve
            cognitive performance. Different age groups can thus be combined for
            a common goal during sports. "This is already being implemented
            selectively with joint exercise programs for children and their
            grandparents," says PÃ¼hse. Such programs could thus be further
            expanded.
            <br />
            <br />
            The same volume of sports activity has a different effect on
            physical fitness for men and women, as we are already aware.
            However, the research group has now been able to verify this for
            mental fitness. Men accordingly benefit more from sporting activity.
            Differences between the sexes are particularly evident in the
            intensity of movement, but not in the type of sport. A hard workout
            seems to be particularly worthwhile for boys and men. Paired with a
            gradual increase in intensity, this leads to a significantly greater
            improvement in cognitive performance over a longer period of time.
            In contrast, the positive effect on women and girls disappears if
            the intensity is increased too quickly. The results of the research
            suggest that they should choose low to medium intensity sporting
            activities if they want to increase their cognitive fitness.
