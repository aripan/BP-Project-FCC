            Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthy. Complete
            nutrition requires ingestion and absorption of vitamins, minerals,
            essential amino acids from protein and essential fatty acids from
            fat-containing food, also food energy in the form of carbohydrate,
            protein, and fat. Dietary habits and choices play a significant role
            in the quality of life, health and longevity.
            <br />
            <br />
            A healthy diet may improve or maintain optimal health. In developed
            countries, affluence enables unconstrained caloric intake and
            possibly inappropriate food choices. Health agencies recommend that
            people maintain a normal weight by limiting consumption of
            energy-dense foods and sugary drinks, eating plant-based food,
            limiting consumption of red and processed meat, and limiting alcohol
            intake. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans is an evidence-based
            information source that policy makers and health professionals use
            to advise the general public about healthy nutrition.
            <br />
            <br />
            Many people choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying
            degrees (e.g. flexitarianism, pescetarianism, vegetarianism,
            veganism) for health reasons, issues surrounding morality, or to
            reduce their personal impact on the environment, although some of
            the public assumptions about which diets have lower impacts are
            known to be incorrect. Raw foodism is another contemporary trend.
            These diets may require multivitamin supplements to meet ordinary
            nutritional needs.
            <br />
            <br />
            A particular diet may be chosen to seek weight loss or weight gain.
            Changing a subject's dietary intake, or "going on a diet", can
            change the energy balance and increase or decrease the amount of fat
            stored by the body. The terms "healthy diet" and "diet for weight
            management" are often related, as the two promote healthy weight
            management.
