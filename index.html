                <p>
                  In nutrition, diet is the sum of food consumed by a person or
                  other organism. The word diet often implies the use of
                  specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management
                  reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans
                  are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food
                  preferences or some food taboos. This may be due to personal
                  tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be
                  more or less healthy. Complete nutrition requires ingestion
                  and absorption of vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids
                  from protein and essential fatty acids from fat-containing
                  food, also food energy in the form of carbohydrate, protein,
                  and fat. Dietary habits and choices play a significant role in
                  the quality of life, health and longevity.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  A healthy diet may improve or maintain optimal health. In
                  developed countries, affluence enables unconstrained caloric
                  intake and possibly inappropriate food choices. Health
                  agencies recommend that people maintain a normal weight by
                  limiting consumption of energy-dense foods and sugary drinks,
                  eating plant-based food, limiting consumption of red and
                  processed meat, and limiting alcohol intake. The Dietary
                  Guidelines for Americans is an evidence-based information
                  source that policy makers and health professionals use to
                  advise the general public about healthy nutrition.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Many people choose to forgo food from animal sources to
                  varying degrees (e.g. flexitarianism, pescetarianism,
                  vegetarianism, veganism) for health reasons, issues
                  surrounding morality, or to reduce their personal impact on
                  the environment, although some of the public assumptions about
                  which diets have lower impacts are known to be incorrect. Raw
                  foodism is another contemporary trend. These diets may require
                  multivitamin supplements to meet ordinary nutritional needs.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  A particular diet may be chosen to seek weight loss or weight
                  gain. Changing a subject's dietary intake, or "going on a
                  diet", can change the energy balance and increase or decrease
                  the amount of fat stored by the body. The terms "healthy diet"
                  and "diet for weight management" are often related, as the two
                  promote healthy weight management.

                  A healthy body is home to a healthy mind: sporting activity
                  can improve your cognitive performance. However, there are
                  numerous different types of sports and a wide range of
                  exercise and training. Which type and how much exercise will
                  keep your mind in top shape? This is the question that has
                  been explored by researchers at the University of Basel and
                  their colleagues at the University of Tsukuba in Japan through
                  a large-scale analysis of the scientific literature. They have
                  used this analysis to derive recommendations that they
                  recently published in the journal Nature Human Behavior.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Just like our physical condition, cognitive performance
                  changes over the course of our lives. There is great for
                  potential for improvement during childhood (cognitive
                  development phase) and during old age (cognitive degradation
                  phase). However, the research group of the Department of
                  Sport, Exercise and Health (DSBG) at the University of Basel
                  was unable to find an indicator of different levels of
                  effectiveness of sporting activities within the varying age
                  groups.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Furthermore, sporting activities from primary school age to
                  later age do not have to be fundamentally different in order
                  to improve cognitive performance. Different age groups can
                  thus be combined for a common goal during sports. "This is
                  already being implemented selectively with joint exercise
                  programs for children and their grandparents," says PÃ¼hse.
                  Such programs could thus be further expanded.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The same volume of sports activity has a different effect on
                  physical fitness for men and women, as we are already aware.
                  However, the research group has now been able to verify this
                  for mental fitness. Men accordingly benefit more from sporting
                  activity. Differences between the sexes are particularly
                  evident in the intensity of movement, but not in the type of
                  sport. A hard workout seems to be particularly worthwhile for
                  boys and men. Paired with a gradual increase in intensity,
                  this leads to a significantly greater improvement in cognitive
                  performance over a longer period of time. In contrast, the
                  positive effect on women and girls disappears if the intensity
                  is increased too quickly. The results of the research suggest
                  that they should choose low to medium intensity sporting
                  activities if they want to increase their cognitive fitness.
